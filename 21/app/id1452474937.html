Fight with Daryl Dixon!\n\nMake friends or fight with other survivors. Do whatever you must to survive. It won’t be easy. The infected are everywhere. Resources are scarce and you must salvage what you can from the carcass of society.\n\n\nIt’s a new world out there. Dangerous, yes, but filled with opportunity. Immense power awaits those bold enough to grasp it. But remember to watch your back. It’s fair to say people aren’t quite as friendly as they used they be…\n\n\nRebuild\n\nBuild up your Settlement to form a safe haven for your survivors and a foundation for your post-apocalyptic empire.\n\n\nRescue\n\nSave survivors to swell your numbers and increase your strength. Locate those with special abilities, they will be the heroes of the plague war!\n\n\nResearch\n\nThe zombie disease is mutating rapidly. Learn whatever you can to understand it. Whoever can control the infection controls the state!\n\n\nSocialize\n\nThere is strength in numbers. Make allies and forge strategic partnerships to survive the horrors of the infected Wilderness. Join forces to pulverize any who try to take advantage of you.\n\n\nRip up the Rulebook\n\nIt’s humanity 2.0. Rewrite the rules on how you want humankind to progress.","screenshot":["https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/d0/a1/89/d0a189e6-1645-50b1-7a57-46c5cab08313/86d5abc1-3943-4281-96d1-d4d9030d0165_2732x2048-1.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/ac/97/bd/ac97bd60-cb4b-a2fa-d851-6517975c3d8a/d164c1b2-4993-436e-a21a-b54a2302c7b4_2732x2048-2.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/1b/57/26/1b5726f4-4eb7-7344-b108-428cbc84c801/2bbb0f87-7083-4c27-957d-ccbf97fa2982_2732x2048-5.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/52/8f/31/528f31cd-a3d7-ebc4-8908-4ef5ce7ed952/2fac7ea1-f37a-4b33-8dca-7248f73d816b_2732x2048-4.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/b2/cb/95/b2cb9581-d2e1-58fe-750c-0d2de97e3f42/0af69f90-49ff-4017-b476-669c74a4c3d5_2732x2048-3.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/6c/2f/de/6c2fdeaf-60e3-1594-5a95-089aa88db430/46843fc0-cc91-4ce7-a140-e3eb6bb5a2a7_2732x2048-6.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/ed/4c/3e/ed4c3e17-69cd-cd2d-777f-179bc7e28a8e/764d98f5-c6b9-434b-af69-3339dc69c71d_2688x1242-1.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/3b/ff/40/3bff404e-2e96-2ffd-3125-25a3b50bdf70/797ebce1-bab4-465b-832e-6b526f08d08e_2688x1242-2.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/5b/68/91/5b6891d2-5606-78bc-b56d-f8aec7fdcf00/456a3f51-4608-4058-aea2-1cc87aee10d7_2688x1242-5.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/17/28/9e/17289e8d-30ff-df24-e3a9-d48d1031899c/a6b7a727-6dd4-440c-9419-9fe98ee2bc3e_2688x1242-4.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/9c/2c/39/9c2c3998-e3fe-2d80-d946-94249d855163/0194e530-8981-4bad-aa52-610ca88022f4_2688x1242-3.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/23/5d/d2/235dd249-6f2b-9dc0-a471-abc311148954/998a2e4b-e759-470c-8cbb-a5cc96da23b4_2688x1242-6.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/1b/c7/8e/1bc78ecb-ed9f-b4ad-1fd5-4068bdc48beb/pr_source.jpg/643x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/ec/d7/ce/ecd7ceb9-8dc2-d7f6-4de6-08a7f7a6bb12/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Games","datePublished":"Aug 29, 2019","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

    Amazing Game!
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Update: I don’t know if they updated it or if the game simply fixed itself, but I no longer have the problem I expressed before. Now I can enjoy this amazing game to its full extent!<br /><br />I absolutely love this game. I’ve only been playing for a few days and I’ve already become so addicted I’ve gladly spent money on it. But unfortunately I’ve recently hit a wall with a game mechanic. Within the game there are states that cities, including your own, reside in. I’ve noticed that some of these states only spawn a certain level of infected enemies, while others can spawn up to much higher levels. While playing through the main mission of the game I was instructed to find and defeat a level 9 infected. Given my own level in the game that would be easy. Unfortunately I reside in a state that only seems to spawn up to level 8 infected. And for some reason whenever I try to attack anything outside of my state it tells me “target no longer exists”. Well I then tried to move my city to a different state, but I’m informed that I can only do that before my city is over level 6. I am far past that and at no point was I told beforehand that it would be in my best interest to move to a different state. I’m very frustrated and I don’t want to start over just to move states because, like I said I’ve already put money into this but I can’t progress at this point. It’s an amazing and well thought out game, but this seems unfair.</p>

    Easy to follow, low priced packages
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve played a couple of games like this one. Upgrade, train, defeat, support your alliance by trading and lowering their time to upgrade, attack other alliances. One in particular I played was difficult to follow at first. They gave a quick tutorial and set you free then never helped you understand how certain upgrade points applied to other parts of the game in order to increase defense and overall strength and knights. You needed communication with your alliance to get help. If you also did not buy enough packages ($5-100), you were going to lose to other alliances who were constantly attacking. This one however encourages you to grow your food and defeat zombies to get better. The packages are $4.99 which makes it easier. Also, when you don’t have enough resources to build or defeat, the game shows you how to get them with a cursor showing you what to tap to help you out. It completely guides you even when you’ve been playing for a while. Still very helpful. <br />There’s a lot of hidden areas to tap to grab the resources you’ve worked for. There’s events to work towards too. There’s also skins for your headquarters which gives you abilities and looks fun, theres options to change your hero, you can change your profile photo to your own or a character’s, you can also arrange your base and make it look however you want.</p>

    Fun and Addictive! LOTS to do!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been playing a week or so; it is a fun addictive game with tons to do. Pokes to spend real money on the game are pretty reasonably not in your face but easily found if you want to go that route. I did spend about $15 on a top-up special and it gave me a big start as far as being able to speed up training and upgrading of my buildings. Worth it to me. Heck, I’d easily spend that on lunch and now that we’re in the COVID-19 era, I’m not going out to lunch as often as I used to so might as well still have some fun! I joined an alliance that is casual but active, which is nice! I love the events and the way that missions and other tasks are kinda staggered so you can play for pretty long periods of time. I wish that I could queue up research when individual research tasks are less than 10 minutes, maybe up to a limit of three tasks. Not a fan of shooty stuff where I have to control individual heroes so I’m really glad I can set the shooty challenges on auto and 3x speed...it is amusing to watch the zombies shamble into bullets and die in that mode. Nicely designed, visually attractive game. I will play for a long time, for sure. I wish there was more stuff to decorate my settlement with! Maybe I will discover there are as I progress.</p>

Now I can enjoy this amazing game to its full extent!\n\nI absolutely love this game. I’ve only been playing for a few days and I’ve already become so addicted I’ve gladly spent money on it. But unfortunately I’ve recently hit a wall with a game mechanic. Within the game there are states that cities, including your own, reside in. I’ve noticed that some of these states only spawn a certain level of infected enemies, while others can spawn up to much higher levels. While playing through the main mission of the game I was instructed to find and defeat a level 9 infected. Given my own level in the game that would be easy. Unfortunately I reside in a state that only seems to spawn up to level 8 infected. And for some reason whenever I try to attack anything outside of my state it tells me “target no longer exists”. Well I then tried to move my city to a different state, but I’m informed that I can only do that before my city is over level 6. I am far past that and at no point was I told beforehand that it would be in my best interest to move to a different state. I’m very frustrated and I don’t want to start over just to move states because, like I said I’ve already put money into this but I can’t progress at this point. It’s an amazing and well thought out game, but this seems unfair.","title":"Amazing Game!","userName":"NerdyGirl24535"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6250203528","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-28T05:00:20Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve played a couple of games like this one. Upgrade, train, defeat, support your alliance by trading and lowering their time to upgrade, attack other alliances. One in particular I played was difficult to follow at first. They gave a quick tutorial and set you free then never helped you understand how certain upgrade points applied to other parts of the game in order to increase defense and overall strength and knights. You needed communication with your alliance to get help. If you also did not buy enough packages ($5-100), you were going to lose to other alliances who were constantly attacking. This one however encourages you to grow your food and defeat zombies to get better. The packages are $4.99 which makes it easier. Also, when you don’t have enough resources to build or defeat, the game shows you how to get them with a cursor showing you what to tap to help you out. It completely guides you even when you’ve been playing for a while. Still very helpful. \nThere’s a lot of hidden areas to tap to grab the resources you’ve worked for. There’s events to work towards too. There’s also skins for your headquarters which gives you abilities and looks fun, theres options to change your hero, you can change your profile photo to your own or a character’s, you can also arrange your base and make it look however you want.","title":"Easy to follow, low priced packages","userName":"Yesdnyl99"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6233118934","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-23T17:47:02Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been playing a week or so; it is a fun addictive game with tons to do. Pokes to spend real money on the game are pretty reasonably not in your face but easily found if you want to go that route. I did spend about $15 on a top-up special and it gave me a big start as far as being able to speed up training and upgrading of my buildings. Worth it to me. Heck, I’d easily spend that on lunch and now that we’re in the COVID-19 era, I’m not going out to lunch as often as I used to so might as well still have some fun! I joined an alliance that is casual but active, which is nice! I love the events and the way that missions and other tasks are kinda staggered so you can play for pretty long periods of time. I wish that I could queue up research when individual research tasks are less than 10 minutes, maybe up to a limit of three tasks. Not a fan of shooty stuff where I have to control individual heroes so I’m really glad I can set the shooty challenges on auto and 3x speed...it is amusing to watch the zombies shamble into bullets and die in that mode.

Also when your in a clan you cannot share your resources with you guild mates on all other games you can share supplies within your guild and they tax you for it which is very helpful cause if your attacked and all of your supplies are taken and they have killed all your troops it will take you a week just to get back to what you had because it takes for ever to collect the resources back to get your troops back if you could share withi. Your guild you could put a tax on the resources that you share so like if you shared a million food or wood the tax could be high to begin with but if you leveled up say a trading station your taxes of resoreces could be reduced but never less than say 10% I just wish it would be more team friendly that away.

Build a settlement, attack zombies and compete with others for rewards. Warning, it is an expensive game. I’m fine with that, my issue is that their support is horrible. If you have any issue, it’s your fault. The game is riddled with bugs that lead to missing rewards (both free, and ones YOU PAID FOR), also some of the benefits (called buffs) you purchase won’t always work. Again, if you contact support, they will immediately say it’s your fault and close the support ticket. I found too many bugs that took things away from me that I paid for, so I stopped putting any money in. I also reported a few mystery charges I did not initiate, again it’s your fault, not theirs. I suggest you play it for free, and resist the urge to spend, because the developers will just find a way to steal from you. Or better yet, just move on to try one of the many other games that are exactly like this. Maybe those developers treat their customers better.\n\n*** Response to developer: More time? Each time I submitted an issue you were quick to close the ticket without asking any follow up questions. I had to submit the same ticket three times for the same bug. Each time having to re-explain the issue to every new agent who responded. You were not interested in fixing the issue, you just wanted to blow off your customer who spent A LOT of money.

There hasn’t been a game I’ve actually enjoyed this much until this game. BUT, I have recently hit a brick wall, I’m a clan leader but the alliance has hit a brick wall with the alliance towers and research because there are no Gas Alliance Nodes along the outskirts meaning you have to move closer towards the middle to get Gas alliance nodes, unfortunately it also makes it harder to move because clans already Staken claim to areas within the map making it harder for smaller clans to grow and build along side of them. Honestly there should be more Gas alliance nodes all over the map especially on the outskirts of the map so it’s fair for all alliances. Also there should also be a  way to @ people in chat whether it’s one person or the clan as a whole. Lastly I feel like clan leaders should have more reign during alliance events for example Alliance Showdown, give the clan leader the chance to move people to different lanes.\n\nHonestly, I want to give this game 5 stars hands down, but there are just things that limit growth in the game whether it’s individual or as a clan. But I still love the game I just wish things could be added to the game ie; Gas Alliance Nodes around the outskirts, since there are already farm, wood, and metal Nodes. It forces smaller clans to have to move where there is no space cause stronger clans already taken up space in the central parts of the map.","title":"Love it!

The graphics are good and there’s plenty of content to do for being a free game. That being said, the developers make it clear they want you to spend money by constantly putting different ‘packs’ everywhere on your screen that can be purchased. One example is that every time you load the game there’s a pack that is offered for 4.99 (right now it’s the Survival of the Fittest pack). You can also pay to have a second construction slot to upgrade buildings, which is reasonable for the price. What isn’t reasonable is that every time you create a new character, you have to purchase the second construction slot again. This was very misleading because I purchased it on my first character thinking it was a one-time only purchase because it literally says that in the game! The game can be played without ever having to pay money, but just know that you won’t ever be as powerful as the people who pay for power(yes this game is pay-to-win). I’ve been playing this game for over 10 months now and I do enjoy it, although sometimes I do get annoyed at how much the game tries to advertise different things that can be purchased. If you are looking for a new game to play that is free I would recommend trying out SoS, but just note that it’s pay-to-win and you’re going to get bombarded with ‘deals’ and offers in the game.","title":"Average free game with good graphics","userName":"deano19892012"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6789590788","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-24T20:59:49Z","developerResponse":{"id":18458013,"body":"Greetings Survivor,\r\nSorry to hear that you feel that way about the game.

I don’t mind being attacked and losing a battle and resources but there no way to continue to grow when you are attacked and destroyed several times a day. Put a limit on how much a player can lose before a free and I mean free shield pops up to save loss of resources based on player level. I liked this game and even in an alliance you get destroyed. It’s a shame I don’t mind spending here and there to play but the cost of a shield is way too expensive. Just another good game that’s going to lose out on the volume of player to please the few big spenders. Such a shame this was a well designed game. It’s almost a great game. But who wants to grind and have nothing to show for it when your not on and have to start over. If you lose a battle pvp you might as well quit moving your base and a shield (peace flare) will break you wallet. I understand the game needs to make money but 100 small spenders will spend more than 1 big spender food for thought.","title":"Good game  with the same old story","userName":"Jozzut"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6112040976","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-23T12:05:10Z","developerResponse":{"id":16553238,"body":"Hello Survivor, \nSorry to hear that you are not satisfied with our game.

The first few levels are great but as you advance upgrades to your buildings take longer and longer until upgrades take hours to complete. To make matters worse you hit a wall on what you can do without upgrading. You cannot queue up your upgrades so the next one starts when the one you are working on finishes. That would be a great feature to help with advancing gameplay while you are off doing real life things like working, going to school or sleeping. You cannot add a second construction slot to work on other things unless you pay real money.  The same goes for training troops. At higher levels it takes hours. Upgrading your hero hits a wall. The really good upgrades, you guessed it, costs real money. Exploring the world? You can send out tow groups to gather resources, which once again, takes hours on higher levels. You cannot get more groups to send out unless, you guessed it again, pay real money. Researching new technologies. You hit the upgrade wall and you can’t research more than one thing at a time unless, you guessed it, pay real money. Do you see a pattern emerging? After a certain point this becomes a wait forever for something to happen or pay to play. I am almost a week into it and have already hit the pay to play wall. I don’t see it staying on my iPad more than another week unless something changes.","title":"Addictive","userName":"michaelspringfield"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6063974933","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-11T18:10:23Z","rating":5,"review":"I began playing this game out of boredom with no expectations or desire to continue to play past the first day. This was not the case however. As soon as I went through the standard learning curve that all mobile RPG/Strategy base building games have, I knew it was a game I can see myself playing and investing time into. This game has a lot of the elements that other successful and popular games of the same genre has, but it is unique enough to keep you interested because it has added features and mechanics to the game that I personally haven’t seen in others. This game doesn’t feel like a “copy and paste” clone of other well known games that many many others  on the app stores have become. The best part about this game in my opinion, is that I do not feel as if it a straight up cash grab game that pressures you into feeling like the only way you will succeed is if you spend a lot of money; if I spend any money, it will be because I want to not because I feel as if I have to. You can enjoy and actually compete within the game without ever spending any money. Overall, it’s a well made game that’s unique enough for veteran mobile game players to at least try out!","title":"Different from the
