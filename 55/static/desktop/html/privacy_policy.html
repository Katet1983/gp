<h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
<li>
<h4>8.1 The right to be informed</h4>
<p>You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily 
understandable information about how we use your personal data and your 
rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this 
Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>8.2 The right of access</h4>
<p>You have the right to obtain access to your personal data. This is so
 you are aware and can check that we are using your personal data in 
accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>Please contact us and submit a request to the email address set forth in the section “Contact Us” below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>8.3 The right to rectification</h4>
<p>You are entitled to have your personal data rectified if they are 
inaccurate or incomplete. If you believe we hold any other personal data
 about you and that information is inaccurate, for information that you 
can change in your game settings, you can change it. And for information
 that you can't change, please contact our Email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>8.4 The right to erasure</h4>
<p>This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple 
terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your personal 
data where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This 
is not an absolute right to erasure and exceptions apply.</p>
<p>You may request that we erase the personal data we hold about you in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold such personal data; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you believe the personal data we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may need to retain personal data if there are valid grounds under 
data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal 
claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the
 case. Where you have requested that we erase personal data that has 
been made available publicly on the Services and there are grounds for 
erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are 
displaying the personal data or providing links to the personal data to 
erase it too.</p>
<p>You can also exercise your right to restrict our processing of your 
personal data (as described below) whilst we consider your request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>8.5 The right to restrict processing</h4>
<p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal data 
we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain 
circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the 
personal data, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data
 protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal claims 
or for another’s protection). As above, where we agree to stop 
processing the personal data, we will try to tell any third party to 
whom we have disclosed the relevant personal data so that they can stop 
processing it too.</p>
<p>You may request we stop processing the personal data we hold about you where:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>you believe the personal data is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you wish to erase the personal data as the processing we are doing is
 unlawful but you want us to retain the personal data but just store it 
instead; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you wish to erase the personal data as it is no longer necessary for 
our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, 
exercise or defense of legal claims. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>8.6 The right to data portability</h4>
<p>You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own 
purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch
 to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your 
personal data easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and 
securely, without affecting its usability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>8.7 The right to object to processing</h4>
<p>You have the right to object to certain types of processing, 
including processing for direct marketing (which we perform only with 
your consent).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>8.8 The right to lodge a complaint</h4>
<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or
