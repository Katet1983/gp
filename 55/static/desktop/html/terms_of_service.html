Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency by us to you are final.</p>
<p>You will not trade, sell, gift, transfer or lend Virtual Goods or

other relevant parties. We have no responsibility for any Virtual 
Transactions, redemptions or refunds of Virtual Goods and/or Virtual 
Currency. We are not responsible for any claims brought against you in 
relation to your use of the Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Currency, 
relating to any Virtual Transactions you enter into or are alleged to 
have entered into.</p>
<p>We may require you to comply with specific policies applicable to the
 purchase and use of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency and we may 
change these policies from time to time. All such policies will form 
part of this EULA. We may modify or eliminate Virtual Goods and/or 
Virtual Currency from some or all Software at any time, with or without 
notice. We will have no liability to you in the event that we exercise 
these rights. If we close Your Account, terminate your access to the 
Software, or terminate this EULA, you will forfeit all Virtual Currency 
and Virtual Goods, and we will have no liability to you for that 
forfeiture.</p>

agree that you will have no claim against us for any statement which is 
not explicitly set out in this EULA. The invalidity of any provision of

enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that

EULA as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the 
extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without 
changing the remaining terms of this EULA. No delay in enforcing any 
provision of this EULA will be construed to be a waiver of any rights 
under that provision. Any rights and obligations under this EULA which 
by their nature should survive, including but not limited to any 
obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) 
given by, the respective parties, will remain in effect after 
termination or expiration of this EULA.</p>
