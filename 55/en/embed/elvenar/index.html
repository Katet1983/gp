🏰  The World of Elvenar  is filled with magic and beauty, home to elves, humans, and fairies. Forge alliances with other players and bring happiness to your people! The society in Elvenar is shrouded in mystery, with ancient civilizations like orcs, fairies, and dwarves having vanished.

Just ensure to keep your diverse populations united by enacting laws and maintaining peace.

🏡  Buildings in Elvenar are not just for beautifying your city but play a crucial role in its development. Construct residences for your citizens, workshops for crafting, and barracks to develop your combat units. Don’t forget the cultural buildings that enhance your citys aesthetics and increase productivity.

🎨 You don’t start the game with all buildings available. As you progress, you’ll unlock more buildings and upgrades that improve their functionality and appearance, making your production more efficient.

⚔️  Battles  in Elvenar focus primarily on peaceful and diplomatic means of resolving conflicts. The game does not feature PvP (Player vs. Player), making it unique for this type of game. Many community members appreciate this more relaxed gameplay.

🌟 During your quest across the land for relics, you will encounter tribes that you can engage with based on your playstyle. If you choose to build a strong army, you’ll need numerous military structures in your kingdom to produce weapons, armor, and combat units. Alternatively, focusing on a manufacturing economy will provide strong trade relationships and a healthy economy with minimal military force.
