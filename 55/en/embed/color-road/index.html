		<meta name="description" content="The game starts slowly, your colored ball rolls down the road. The goal: to go as far as possible. How do you do it? You have to avoid the balls of a different color than yours.

At the beginning, this ball game is simple, but the difficulty comes when the balls are no longer immobile in front of you and you constantly change color! Indeed, you will have to pass on stepping stones which will make you change color.

Color Road is a simple yet challenging game with harmonious and colorful interface to provide players with a comfortable visual experience.">
