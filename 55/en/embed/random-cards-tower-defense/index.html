		<meta name="description" content="Random Cards: Tower Defense is not an easy game. But you should not be afraid. Consider it a challenge! Consider that you need to become a champion.
Assemble a team of the strongest or smash the enemy one-on-one. Keep in mind that in order to win, you will need to calculate all the actions. Every step must be thought out. Play out different tower defense scenarios, make wise decisions, improve cards. And be prepared for the fact that you will have to make difficult decisions!
Each card has its own strength and its own power. The outcome of the battle will not depend only on chance.">
