		<meta name="description" content="The war passed, thousands of bombs destroyed cities, forests and fields. Everything was burned and only ruins remained.
The world needs a hero who will unite disparate people of all ages and rebuild cities, someone who will re-grow forests - a person who can rekindle hope for a peaceful existence in the hearts of people and revive life after the era of war.
And that person is you!
It is you who are able to unite people, rebuild houses, factories, factories. Rescue people from the rubble and restore forests. Revive the cities and lead the country to prosperity!">
