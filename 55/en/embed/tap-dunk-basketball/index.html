		<meta name="description" content="Endless Tap Dunk Basketball game. Have time to hit the ball into the basket ring, make combos of swishes so that the ball does not touch the basket ring. Get balls by unlocking achievements.

Tap Dunk Basketball is an endless game with simple rules but complex controls where you have to hit the ball into the basket ring.

The complexity of the control lies in the need to predict the right moment of the throw so that the ball hits the ring exactly. With a single tap, the ball always flies to a certain height towards the ring. Tap several times to throw the ball higher. You will get used to ball control and physics over time.

Make consistent swishes (without touching the ring) to earn more points. The first swish in the sequence is worth 2 points, 2x is worth 3 points, 3 is worth 4 points, and so on.

Unlock all available ball skins by earning achievements.

Good luck!">
