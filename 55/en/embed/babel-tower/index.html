		<meta name="description" content="You are building the Tower of Babel, that will reach to the sky!
You have a team of professionals: miners, masons, crafters, lumberjacks, builders, who will help you achieve success in this incremental idle game.

New fun machines are unlocked with every tower floor.

The game was made by Airapport and expands our idle games universe. 

Controls

Restarting your tower building gives you Golden Bricks, which boost your tap power, production and increase market prices.
