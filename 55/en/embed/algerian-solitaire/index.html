🎯 Objective:

🃏 Deal &amp; Layout:
   Algerian Patience is played with two decks (104 cards). Six cards are dealt face-up to each of the six reserve piles. The tableau piles receive one face-up card each, with the first four getting an extra card. Remaining cards go face-down into the stock.

🔀 Allowed Moves:
   - The tableau builds in-suit, both up and down. Card ranks are continuous.
   - Move one card at a time. An empty tableau pile can be filled with any card.
   - No building on the reserve. Cards move from the reserve to the tableau or foundation.
   - Clicking the stock deals two face-up cards to each reserve pile, except the last time when it deals one face-up card to each tableau pile.
   - First four foundations build up in-suit starting with Ace, while the last four build down in-suit starting with King.

🏆 Scoring:
   - Gain 5 points for each card moved from reserve to tableau.
   - Earn 10 points for each card moved to the foundation (from tableau or reserve).
   - Moving a card from foundation back to tableau results in a 15-point deduction.

❓ FAQ:
   - How to win? Move all cards to the foundation. Strategy tip: Immediately move cards to the foundation when possible and create empty spaces in the tableau.
   - Scoring: Earn points for moving cards to the foundation and introducing cards to the game. Face a penalty for moving a card from foundation back to tableau.
