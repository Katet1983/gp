		<meta name="description" content="Today we are expanding our collection with a great new game: plane wash. After all, it is so much fun to beat equipment and repair it! And so, lets get started. We have to move to a large hangar, where, after exhausting flights, helicopters and airplanes arrive to wash, and prepare for the next flight. And your task is to put them in order. A lot of machinery and even a space shuttle have already gathered at the car wash. Choose anyone and get down to business as soon as possible.">
