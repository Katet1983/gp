		<meta name="description" content="In the game at frivls.com, you need to find matching numbers that add up to 10. You can connect these numbers vertically, horizontally, and diagonally to remove them. Players in this game engage in a strategic battle to solve puzzles and improve their strategies.

You should also be cautious because you have limited moves. When you run out of moves, a horizontal or vertical line is added to the board. The line can be cleared when all the numbers in it are removed. However, if a line is added when there is a number in the top row of the board, the game ends with your loss.

Enjoy the challenges and fun of friv and use your wits to cleverly match numbers to reach the top of the leaderboard. Go ahead and visit the website now to enjoy this exciting game.">
