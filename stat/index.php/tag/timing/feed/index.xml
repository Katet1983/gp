										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One Cell is a solitaire card game. You can have fun in a poker game here. It is a little difficult, you have to match specific cards. The cards matching in numerical order, but only the different colors can match. This makes the game harder. But I believe you can solve this card puzzle by your wisdom. The Aces will be collected that can help you a little. Also, you can put a card to the free cell temporarily when you have no way to move the cards. Only you have three chances to undo the moves. If you can not figure out, only one thing you can do is restart.<br />drag to play</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese Chess board game against a computer opponent. To win you need to capture the general of your opponent. Xiangqi, also called Chinese chess or Elephant chess, is a strategy board game for two players. It is one of the most popular board games in China. The game represents a battle between two armies, with the object of capturing the enemy&#8217;s general. Distinctive features of xiangqi include the cannon, which must jump to capture, a rule prohibiting the generals from facing each other directly, areas on the board called the river and palace, which restrict the movement of some pieces, and placement of the pieces on the intersections of the board lines, rather than within the squares.<br />Click and drag the mouse to play.</p>
